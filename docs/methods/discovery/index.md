# Introduction to UX discovery

UX discovery is a collection of methods to uncover business requirements and the competitive landscape.

## Creating products

To create a product, we need to understand three things:

### Desirability

**Do people want or need this?** Find this out by getting out of the building and asking them. Activities could include user testing, surveys, analytics, in-depth interviews and diary studies.

### Feasibility

**Can it be built?** Talk with developers to find out.

### Viability

**Does it fulfill a business need?** Talk with businesspeople who have a stake in the work.

If we only focus on a solution or features, we may miss other possibility's which are much stronger. Therefore we need to gather data from all areas before we start to decided upon the best direction.

## Features arms race

Design for user goals, not what we can build. For example:

* Apple TV remote vs. any DVD/VHS remote.
* Google Docs vs. Microsoft Word.

## Design process

Discovery happens at the beginning of the design process. Our aim is to take the problem and explore it fully.
