# Lean user personas

Personas are extremely helpful when designing products and services, helping stakeholders (and designers) keep  the users in mind and see the problem from their perspective.

Although they're technically a deliverable, the actual finished document isn't all that valuable. What is valuable however, is the process of involving your team in its creation, learning from users and building empathy in the group.

This means personas don't need to be elaborate - no need for reams of detail or fancy designs as long as they present enough information for the team to make decisions. Unless they need to be presented to a stakeholder, in which case: go nuts.

## Difference between UX and marketing personas

## What to include

### Name and photo

Give them a nickname based on their behaviour if you like, such as 'Upgrade Dave'. A photo helps, but a quick doodle is fine too.

### Job title

This is more useful for business-to-business personas, but can still be helpful to understand their background and approach.

### Goals and needs

Explore the psychology of your persona - why does this person make the decisions they do? What are their goals, what are their fears?

### Behaviours and beliefs

Make sure the details are relevant, for example *Indescisive Ian is so embarrased by his lack of washing machine knowledge he'd never ask his friends for help.*

### Characteristics

To determine the persona characteristics, identify patterns between your users. Once you've created the categories, group similar people into personas. One persona could be a combination of a number of real but similar people.
