# Define the problem

The purpose of this phase is to get a thorough understanding of the problem we're trying to solve by ensuring we've asked enough questions and challenged any assumptions.

### Create a project plan.

While it may seem a lot of work, doing this before anything else will save you a lot of trouble in the long-term.
