# Define the problem

The purpose of this phase is to get a thorough understanding of the problem we're trying to solve by ensuring we've asked enough questions and challenged any assumptions.

It's important that we don't start work without a well thought-out problem statement. Never accept being handed a solution to implement – keep digging until you find the underlying problem.

## Things you must do

### Agree a problem statement.

The problem statement is the core of your project and the reason why you're doing it in the first place. If we're not solving a problem for our customers or the business, then we probably shouldn't be doing it.

Write down who they are, their role, their interest, any control over the project they may have and how frequently they need to be involved. This will help you build a plan for communicating effectively with them, understand where signoffs and other approvals may need to happen and build in the time accordingly.

For example, your squad may need to be updated daily in standups, while a senior manager

### Create a project plan.

While it may seem a lot of work, doing this before anything else will save you a lot of trouble in the long-term.
