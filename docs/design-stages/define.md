# Define the problem

The purpose of this phase is to get a thorough understanding of the problem we're trying to solve by ensuring we've asked enough questions and challenged any assumptions.

!!! warning

	It's essential we always have a well thought-out problem statement before starting work. Never accept being handed a solution to implement – keep digging until you find the underlying problem.

## Agree a problem statement

The problem statement is the core of your project and the reason why you're doing it in the first place. If we're not solving a problem for our customers or the business, then we probably shouldn't be doing it.

Don't be afraid to challenge the problem and never settle for being handed a solution. Ask yourself:

* Is this the right problem to solve? 
* Do we know it's actually a problem, or is it just conjecture?
* Is it a symptom of a deeper problem we should solve instead?
* What is the impact on our customers and the business?
* What insights do we have that validate the problem statement? This could be customer feedback, qualatitive and quantitive data, secondary research etc.

Don't start work until you're happy with it.

If there isn't a problem statement or the team is not sure which problem to focus on first, you should go through a [UX discovery phase](/methods/discovery/) to to uncover the business requirements and competitive landscape.

## Define the success metrics

How will the success of this project be measured? How will you know whether it's been successful or not? What performance metrics will you be measuring?

Todo: What's success for UX as well as the business/customer?

## Develop a communications plan

Think about the different stakeholders in your project. These are basically anyone with some sort of interest in it, for example, could be members of your squad, the wider UX team, people in other teams, product managers, senior managers etc. 

Write down who they are, their role, their interest, any control over the project they may have and how frequently they need to be updated. This will help you build a plan for communicating effectively with them, including when signoffs and other approvals may need to happen and allowing you to build in time for this accordingly.

**Example comms plan:**

* **Squad members** – Update daily in standups.
* **UX team members** - Update weekly in design reviews.
* **Product manager** - Update weekly in refinement session.
* **Senior manager** – Wants sign-off before build, allow two weeks for amends and approvals.

!!! Note
	
	By thinking about who else is involved with your project and what they may need, you can ensure everyone who needs to be involved is involved and you're not caught out at the last minute by stakeholders wanting input or sign-off.

## Create a project plan

A project plan, even a brief one, will help you work out the activites you'll do, which deliverables you'll create, what resources you'll need and how much time it's all going to take. This is more important for larger projects, but even the smallest ones will benefit from some up-front thought.

* **Activites** - These are the things you're going to do, for example workshops, user testing, research etc.

* **Deliverables** - These are the things you're going to produce, such as wireframes, personas, site maps, UI designs, prototypes etc.

* **Resources** – These are the things you're going to need, for example analytics support, testing support, copywriting and translation.
